  A simple serial port data  visualize tool.
  Writen for Linux, but may be compiled under Win (theoretically).
  Uses SDL2, SDL2-ttf

  Sure, there are many ways to define data structures and I see that some 
things I would do now in a bit another way, but may be through several commits
I will reach it and  my inner perfectionist will find a balance in a fight 
with external and internal "entropy".

Best regards, ES
